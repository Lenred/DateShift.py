# Date Shift Cipher Program
**Description**
This program performs a Date Shift Cipher on a given word or phrase. The user inputs a date and a text, and the program outputs the scrambled text based on the digits in the date.

**How to Run**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the program code in a file, for example, date_shift_cipher.py.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the program file.
4. Run the command python date_shift_cipher.py.
5. Follow the prompts to enter a date and text for encryption.
**Usage**
Upon running the program, you will see a prompt for the date:


```date:```

Enter a date in any format but note that only the digits will be used for the cipher.

Next, you'll see a prompt for the text to be encrypted:


```text:```

Enter the text and press Enter. The program will output the encrypted text.

# ++++ Future Ideas ++++
1. Two-Way Encryption/Decryption: Enhance the program to not only encrypt but also decrypt messages.
2. User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the program more user-friendly.
3. Date Validation: Implement date validation to ensure that the entered date is in a proper format. (maybe include Oct is 10 Nov is 11 etc.)
